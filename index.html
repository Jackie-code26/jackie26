                <p>I don't know. There is not one thing, that I can exactly say about myself. I don't know who I am. Even though I am the one who knows myself the best, and yet I am here, thinking what I would say about myself. Because there isn't exactly a word, a sentence, that would be enough to describe who I am. I am a complicated person. I will say that I want attention at the time I want to be alone, and I would scream at people to leave me alone when I need them with me. I like myself. But I do not, at the same time. And I don't mind it being that way. </p>
